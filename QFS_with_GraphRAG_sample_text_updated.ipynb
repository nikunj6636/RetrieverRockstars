        "# GraphRAG Implementation with LlamaIndex\n",
        "\n",
        "[GraphRAG (Graphs + Retrieval Augmented Generation)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/graphrag/) combines the strengths of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Query-Focused Summarization (QFS) to effectively handle complex queries over large text datasets. While RAG excels in fetching precise information, it struggles with broader queries that require thematic understanding, a challenge that QFS addresses but cannot scale well. GraphRAG integrates these approaches to offer responsive and thorough querying capabilities across extensive, diverse text corpora.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook provides guidance on constructing the GraphRAG pipeline using the LlamaIndex PropertyGraph abstractions.\n",

        "**NOTE:** This is an approximate implementation of GraphRAG. We are currently developing a series of cookbooks that will detail the exact implementation of GraphRAG."

        "The GraphRAG involves two steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Graph Generation - Creates Graph, builds communities and its summaries over the given document.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Graph Generation:**\n",

        "1. **Source Documents to Text Chunks:** Source documents are divided into smaller text chunks for easier processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Text Chunks to Element Instances:** Each text chunk is analyzed to identify and extract entities and relationships, resulting in a list of tuples that represent these elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Element Instances to Element Summaries:** The extracted entities and relationships are summarized into descriptive text blocks for each element using the LLM.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Element Summaries to Graph Communities:** These entities, relationships and summaries form a graph, which is subsequently partitioned into communities using algorithms using Heirarchical Leiden to establish a hierarchical structure.\n",

        "**Community Summaries to Global Answers:** The summaries of the communities are utilized to respond to user queries. This involves generating intermediate answers, which are then consolidated into a comprehensive global answer.\n"

        "This functionality is similar to that of the `SimpleLLMPathExtractor`, but includes additional enhancements to handle entity, relationship descriptions.
